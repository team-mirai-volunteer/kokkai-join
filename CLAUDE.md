# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Architecture

This is the **kokkai-join** project, a monorepo containing a Next.js frontend application with a planned backend directory. The project appears to be in early development stages with a standard Next.js setup.

### Repository Structure
- `frontend/` - Next.js 15.4.6 application with React 19.1.0
- `backend/` - (Currently empty, likely for future API development)
- `tools/` - (Currently empty, likely for development utilities)

### Frontend Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.4.6 with App Router
- **React**: Version 19.1.0
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support with strict configuration
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with PostCSS
- **Package Manager**: Bun for dependency installation only; npm for all other tasks
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack (enabled in dev script)
- **Fonts**: Geist Sans and Geist Mono from Google Fonts

## Common Development Commands

All commands should be run from the `frontend/` directory:

### Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev          # Start development server with Turbopack
```

### Build and Production
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run start        # Start production server
```

### Code Quality
```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint         # Run ESLint via Next.js
npm test             # Run tests with Vitest
```

### Package Management
```bash
cd frontend
bun install          # Install dependencies (use bun for installation only)
bun add <package>    # Add new dependency
bun add -d <package> # Add development dependency
```

## TypeScript Configuration

The project uses strict TypeScript settings:
- Target: ES2017
- Strict mode enabled
- Path aliases: `@/*` maps to `./src/*`
- Next.js TypeScript plugin enabled

## Development Notes

### Frontend Structure
- Uses Next.js App Router architecture
- Main application code in `frontend/src/app/`
- Current pages: Root layout (`layout.tsx`) and home page (`page.tsx`)
- Tailwind CSS for styling with custom CSS variables for theming
- Font optimization using `next/font/google`

### Project Status
This appears to be a fresh Next.js project created with `create-next-app`. The backend directory exists but is currently empty, suggesting this will be a full-stack application.

### Development Server
- Runs on http://localhost:3000 by default
- Uses Turbopack for faster development builds
- Hot reload enabled for immediate feedback

## Architecture Considerations

Since this is a monorepo structure with separate frontend and backend directories, future development should maintain clear separation between client and server code. The empty backend directory suggests plans for a Node.js/Express API or similar backend implementation.
